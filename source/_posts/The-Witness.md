## Tetris-like blocks
Tetris puzzles require you to draw tetris shapes with your line and make sure the space that you've drawn contains the corresponding symbols. You can combine two or more symbols to put them in one space, but you can not overlap them. The shape itself doesn't necessarily need to contain the symbol - the only requirement is the space you've drawn does need to contain it.
